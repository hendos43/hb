In this experiment we want to analyse the effect of contact through the traces it leaves, and differences in contact from individuals. Can we draw any conclusions from our observations? With a less than scientific study, are any of these conclusions valid? Can the images infer anything about the individuals outside of their method of peeling an orange?

In a range of twelve participants, many notable moments occurred, from which suppositions can be made. The only rules were that participants could not clean their hands before being photographed, and they couldnâ€™t eat the fruit until it had been documented. Some asked to use a knife, others peeled the orange knowing they would not be the person eating it.

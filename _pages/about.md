Studying habitual behaviour led to the discovery that by meddling with learnt and unconscious actions or disrupting ordinary interactions, you can trigger and enable a state of novelty or strangeness - acting as a catalyst for instigating communication and encounters that might not otherwise take place.

Through participation in these experiences, individuals' idiosyncratic behaviour became  foregrounded, establishing an opportunity for greater understanding on a personal and collective level.

As the project developed we introduced an additional participant - the computer - and asked ourselves, what is the most important way we evaluate our experiences? Through feelings and embodied understanding or through computation and metrics?
